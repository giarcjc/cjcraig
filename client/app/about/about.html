  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>I am a web developer currently living in Denver, CO. I have a wife, 3 kids, and a lot less hair than I used to.  Besides coding, I enjoy <a href="http://chriscraigguitar.com">playing music</a>, watching movies, playing video games, and spending time outdoors.</p>
  
   <p>Since 1999 I've worked in various roles including front-end developer, QA engineer, and manager. I'm currently employed as a software engineer for an established financial company.  For several years I was head of the web services department for a small midwestern college. As an independent contractor I have built quality inexpensive websites for individuals, small-businesses, churches and non-profits. And as part of a development team I've contributed to projects for enterprises including SEGA, Round1, SunGard, and The United States Treasury.</p>
   
   <p>Since Spring 2014 I've been working mostly with the MEAN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, Angular.js, Node.js) and deploying in Docker. This website was build using that stack.  But of course in 16 years of development I've worked with plenty of other technologies including Java (Spring, Hibernate, MySQL, DB2, WebSphere, Tomcat), .NET (SQL Server, IIS, Entity-Framework), PHP (Drupal, Wordpress, MySQL, Linux, Apache), and a little bit of Ruby and Perl. </p>
 
<p>Although I'm not currently looking for full-time work, I am available for limited contract work. <a ui-sref="contact">Drop me a line</a> and I'll be happy to discuss your project and what I can bring to the table.</p>
